## ⚙️ Setup (for Development)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/doc-approve.git
   cd doc-approve
   ```

2. **Configure your MySQL database in `application.properties`:**
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/documentflow
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=your-password
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash

## 🔑 Authentication Flow

- **Register:** `POST /register`  
  Registers a new user (password is securely encoded)

- **Login:** `POST /login`  
  Returns a JWT token upon valid credentials

- **Protected Endpoints:**  
  Pass token as Bearer in `Authorization` header:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
  ```
